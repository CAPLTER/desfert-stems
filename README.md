## desfert-stems

This repository contains the materials for creating the ~~ODK~~ KoBo stem-measurement and plant biovolume applications, and tools & procedures for processing collected data.

Since moving away from paper data sheets, the workflow for collecting and processing stems data has evolved through many iterations. The first application was build with ODK, with a processing workflow that entailed manually downloading data files from the tablets then extracting the information with ODK's Briefcase tool with subsequent formatting and upload to the urbancndep database. As support fro Briefcase eroded, a manual workflow to harvest data directly from XML files downloaded from the tablets was developed. In the most recent iteration, we switched from ODK to the KoBo ecosystem, which provides better cloud support. In this new KoBo-centric worfklow, the application logic is uploaded to KoBoToolbox as an Excel file, which can then be downloaded to the tablets. Data collected in the field is then uploaded to KoBoToolbox. At the end of a sampling campaign, data are exported from KoBoToolbox as an Excel file. The kobo_workflow.R details harvesting data from the Excel file with appropriate formatting for upload to the database.
